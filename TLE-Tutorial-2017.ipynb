    "## Electromagnetic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward modeling is an important part of understanding controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) responses. The diffusive term in the electromagnetic wave equation is dominant over the displacement term at these frequencies. It is the diffusive behavior that makes it difficult to imagine the actual propagation of the signal. An important tool in gaining experience therefore is forward modeling, and lots of it. The advantage of one-dimensional (1D) forward modeling, besides its speed, is to study isolated effects (see for instance [Key, 2009](#References)): What is the influence of resistivity anisotropy, or of fine-scale resistivity variations? What is the influence of the airwave? With 1D modeling you can quickly study these effects in isolation before you go on to more complex models in higher dimensions. For an introduction to CSEM for hydrocarbon exploration see, for instance [Constable (2010)](#References).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily the EM community can count on some freely available, stable, high-quality, and open-source CSEM modeling codes. Well-known ones are the codes from the Marine EM Lab at Scripps: `DIPOLE1D` ([Key, 2009](#References)) and `MARE2DEM` ([Key and Ovall, 2011](#References)) for 1D and 2D modeling. `DIPOLE1D` is an isotropic EM modeler for a stratified model using the diffusive approximation valid for low frequencies such as used in CSEM (neglecting displacement currents). `MARE2DEM` is a 2.5D CSEM and magnetotelluric (MT) modeling and inversion code, including resistivity anisotropy. More recently, [Cockett et al. (2015)](#References) published `SimPEG` , and [Hunziker et al. (2015)](#References) `EMmod` . `SimPEG` is a framework for 3D simulation and modeling of all sorts of geophysical methods, among them CSEM. `EMmod` is a 1D electromagnetic modeler including anisotropy in the form of vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) resistivity as well as VTI electric permittivity and VTI magnetic permeability, therefore modeling the whole wavefield for electric and magnetic sources and receivers.\n",

    "## `empymod`\n",

    "In this tutorial I use the 1D electromagnetic forward modeling code `empymod`, which is based on:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **[Hunziker et al. (2015)](#References)**, for the wavenumber-domain calculation of the EM field. The authors\n",
    "  obtained the electromagnetic field by solving two equivalent scalar equations with a scalar\n",
    "  global reflection coefficient, for a layered earth with vertical transverse isotropy (VTI).\n",
    "- **[Key (2012)](#References)**, for the Hankel and Fourier transforms. Key compares the fast Hankel transform\n",
    "  (FHT, e.g. [Anderson, 1979](References)) to quadrature-with-extrapolation (QWE), both are much faster than the\n",
    "  Gauss-Kronrod quadrature used in `EMmod` by [Hunziker et al. (2015)](#References). Both methods can be applied\n",
    "  for the Hankel and the Fourier transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to get `empymod`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conda**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        conda install -c conda-forge empymod\n",
    "    \n",
    "   If you are using the Anaconda Navigator, just add the channel `conda-forge` and empymod will appear in the package list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pip**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pip install empymod\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Download, clone, or fork on **GitHub**: [github.com/emsig/empymod](https://github.com/emsig/empymod).\n",
    "   To install it run\n",
    "\n",
    "        make install\n",
    "\n",
    "   or simply put it in your working directory or Python-PATH to use it without installation at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum requirement is Python 3.4 or higher, and `NumPy` and `SciPy`. The easiest way to meet all requirements if you are new to Python is to use the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electromagnetic python modeller `empymod` can model electric or magnetic responses due to a three-dimensional electric or magnetic source in a layered-earth model (Figure 1) with $n$ layers, each with electric vertical isotropy ($\\rho_\\text{h}$, $\\lambda$), horizontal and vertical electric permittivity ($\\epsilon_\\text{h}$, $\\epsilon_\\text{v}$), and horizontal and vertical magnetic permeability ($\\mu_\\text{h}$, $\\mu_\\text{v}$), from very low frequencies ($f \\to$ 0 Hz) to very high frequencies ($f \\to$ GHz). The layer parameters all default to 1 if not provided ($\\rho_\\text{h}$ is mandatory).\n",

    "From this example, you can infer that an infinitesimally small *dipole* is defined as $[x, y, z,$ azimuth, dip$]$, using a left-handed coordinate system with positive z pointing downward. The azimuth is the anti-clockwise deviation from the x-axis, and the dip is the deviation downward from the xy-plane. A finite length *bipole*, on the other hand, would be defined as $[x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, z_1, z_2]$, where $[x_1, y_1, z_1]$ is the first pole location, and $[x_2, y_2, z_2]$ is the second pole location.

The jump in the time-domain response is the so-called airwave; this is why the switch-on response is sometimes also called step-response.

If both source and receiver are bipoles, and you interpolate with 5 points each, you need 25 times longer to model the bipole-bipole survey instead of the simplified dipole-dipole survey.\n",
